<p><strong>Virtual reality</strong> (or VR) is a computer technology that uses software-generated realistic images,</p> 
<p>sounds and other sensations to replicate a real environment or any setting, </p>
<p>and simulates a user's physical presence in this environment to enable the user to interact with this environment.</p>
<p>A person using virtual reality equipmentcan look around the world, move about in it and interact with features or items that are depicted.</p>
<p>Virtual realities artificially create sensory experiences, which can include sight, touch, hearing, and, less commonly, smell.</p>
<p>Some simulations include additional sensory information and provide sounds through speakers or headphones.</p>
